Aangan Terminology Notice
Effective: 2025-10-10

All communications at Aangan must avoid the term period in any context. Use menstrual cycle instead across product copy, support content, research documents, and internal notes.
This guideline applies to UI labels, notifications, emails, push messages, knowledge-base articles, and presentations. If legacy text contains the prohibited term, update it to menstrual cycle before publishing.
Reviews will block releases that include the prohibited term. Direct questions or edge cases to the Content Standards owner via the tracking ticket.
