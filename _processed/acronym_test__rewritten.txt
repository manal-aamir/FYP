Our Operations Knowledge Base (OKB) project was accelerated through the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) pipeline using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) for edge communication and Open Platform Communications (OPC)-User Agent (UA) for factory sensors. The Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR)-based system collected Red Green Blue (RGB)-D data while YOLOv9 and ViT-L models performed real-time inference on the Jetson Nvidia Jetson Agx Platform (AGX) nodes. Later, the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow integrated Facebook Ai Similarity Search (FAISS) indexing and BM25 retrieval, improving Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)@10 and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) metrics by 14%.

The enterprise team migrated from Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to a hybrid FaaS architecture, orchestrated through Knative and Istio service meshes. Our Continuous Integration (CI) observability was strengthened using OTel traces integrated into Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana (ELK) and Prometheus–Grafana stacks. The Technical Program Manager (TPM) led a full Root Cause Analysis (RCA) on the latency spikes and concluded that gRPC payload compression would reduce p95 response times by 22%.

The research division built a Vision Language Model (VLM) fine-tuned on multimodal corpora using LoRA adapters and Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) layers. The model achieved better Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score (BLEU) and Recall-Oriented Understudy For Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) scores on evaluation datasets, with experiments logged via MLflow and CometML. Further, the engineers containerized the inference microservice with Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) Runtime and deployed it using Helm on Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters.

On the finance front, Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Economic Value Added (EVA) calculations were automated via Visual Basic For Applications (VBA) scripts within the Financial Planning (FP)&A sheet, while Environmental, Social, And Governance (ESG) and Task Force On Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting frameworks were implemented for sustainability metrics. Treasury optimized Foreign Exchange (FX) hedging by integrating Society For Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) MT940 feeds into Snowflake using dbt transformations. The Investor Relations (IR) team presented Earnings Per Share (EPS) growth at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) supported by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)-aligned statements.

The marketing analytics unit linked Customer Data Platform (CDP) data with Demand Side Platform (DSP) retargeting APIs to improve Return On Ad Spend (ROAS) across campaigns. Using Mixpanel and Segment SDKs, they tracked Monthly Active Users (MAU), Daily Active Users (DAU), and Lifetime Value (LTV):Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) ratios across cohorts. Meanwhile, User Generated Content (UGC) content from KOLs on Douyin and Xiaohongshu was analyzed through a multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT) model for sentiment clustering.

The cybersecurity department adopted a Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) approach, integrating Endpoint Detection And Response (EDR) and Extended Detection And Response (XDR) agents across endpoints with User And Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) analytics dashboards. Threat intelligence feeds from Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) and Trusted Automated Exchange Of Indicator Information (TAXII) servers were normalized in Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) format. A Security Information And Event Management (SIEM) alert automation using Security Orchestration Automation And Response (SOAR) reduced Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) metrics substantially, while the Security Operations Center (SOC) team maintained compliance with Center For Internet Security (CIS) v8 benchmarks.

In HRTech, our Human Capital Management (HCM) and Applicant Tracking System (ATS) platforms synchronized via Representational State Transfer (REST) and GraphQL endpoints. Employee OKRs were linked to Learning Management System (LMS) course completions, and Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion (DEI) reporting dashboards tracked gender parity KPIs quarterly. Payroll APIs interfaced with National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) and Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) protocols to ensure timely multi-currency disbursements.

The supply-chain transformation incorporated Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and IoT telemetry into Manufacturing Execution System (MES) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. Predictive maintenance was achieved using AutoML models trained on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) streams, identifying anomalies in Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) metrics. Blockchain-based provenance tracking ensured Service Level Agreement (SLA) transparency for suppliers via Hyperledger Fabric nodes.

The product roadmap for FY26 includes integration of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) bots for invoice Optical Character Recognition (OCR), digital twin simulations via Unity-Machine Learning (ML), and synthetic data generation with Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) pipelines. The architecture team plans to add a Federated Reinforcement Learning (RL) module for personalization while integrating Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) security controls across Wide Area Network (WAN) edges. Combined, these initiatives will strengthen the company’s position ahead of Initial Public Offering (IPO) readiness.
