Our Operations Knowledge Base (Operations Knowledge Base (OKB)) project was accelerated through the Exploratory Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)) pipeline using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)) for edge communication and Open Platform Communications (Open Platform Communications (OPC))-User Agent (User Agent (UA)) for factory sensors. The Light Detection And Ranging (Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR))-based system collected Red Green Blue (Red Green Blue (RGB))-D data while YOLOv9 and ViT-L models performed real-time inference on the Jetson Nvidia Jetson Nvidia Jetson Agx Platform (AGX) Platform (Nvidia Jetson Agx Platform (AGX)) nodes. Later, the Retrieval Augmented Generation (Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)) workflow integrated Facebook Ai Similarity Search (Facebook Ai Similarity Search (FAISS)) indexing and BM25 retrieval, improving Monthly Recurring Revenue (Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR))@10 and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)) metrics by 14%.

The enterprise team migrated from Service-Oriented Architecture (Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)) to a hybrid FaaS architecture, orchestrated through Knative and Istio service meshes. Our Continuous Integration (Continuous Integration (CI)) observability was strengthened using OTel traces integrated into Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana (Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana (ELK)) and Prometheus–Grafana stacks. The Technical Program Manager (Technical Program Manager (TPM)) led a full Root Cause Analysis (Root Cause Analysis (RCA)) on the latency spikes and concluded that gRPC payload compression would reduce p95 response times by 22%.

The research division built a Vision Language Model (Vision Language Model (VLM)) fine-tuned on multimodal corpora using LoRA adapters and Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)) layers. The model achieved better Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy Score (BLEU)) and Recall-Oriented Understudy For Gisting Evaluation (Recall-Oriented Understudy For Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)) scores on evaluation datasets, with experiments logged via MLflow and CometML. Further, the engineers containerized the inference microservice with Open Neural Network Exchange (Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)) Runtime and deployed it using Helm on Elastic Kubernetes Service (Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)) clusters.

On the finance front, Discounted Cash Flow (Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)) and Economic Value Added (Economic Value Added (EVA)) calculations were automated via Visual Basic For Applications (Visual Basic For Applications (VBA)) scripts within the Financial Planning (Financial Planning (FP))&A sheet, while Environmental, Social, And Governance (Environmental, Social, And Governance (ESG)) and Task Force On Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (Task Force On Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)) reporting frameworks were implemented for sustainability metrics. Treasury optimized Foreign Exchange (Foreign Exchange (FX)) hedging by integrating Society For Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Society For Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)) MT940 feeds into Snowflake using dbt transformations. The Investor Relations (Investor Relations (IR)) team presented Earnings Per Share (Earnings Per Share (EPS)) growth at the Annual General Meeting (Annual General Meeting (AGM)) supported by International Financial Reporting Standards (International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS))-aligned statements.

The marketing analytics unit linked Customer Data Platform (Customer Data Platform (CDP)) data with Demand Side Platform (Demand Side Platform (DSP)) retargeting APIs to improve Return On Ad Spend (Return On Ad Spend (ROAS)) across campaigns. Using Mixpanel and Segment SDKs, they tracked Monthly Active Users (Monthly Active Users (MAU)), Daily Active Users (Daily Active Users (DAU)), and Lifetime Value (Lifetime Value (LTV)):Customer Acquisition Cost (Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)) ratios across cohorts. Meanwhile, User Generated Content (User Generated Content (UGC)) content from KOLs on Douyin and Xiaohongshu was analyzed through a multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers (BERT)) model for sentiment clustering.

The cybersecurity department adopted a Zero Trust Network Access (Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)) approach, integrating Endpoint Detection And Response (Endpoint Detection And Response (EDR)) and Extended Detection And Response (Extended Detection And Response (XDR)) agents across endpoints with User And Entity Behavior Analytics (User And Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)) analytics dashboards. Threat intelligence feeds from Malware Information Sharing Platform (Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP)) and Trusted Automated Exchange Of Indicator Information (Trusted Automated Exchange Of Indicator Information (TAXII)) servers were normalized in Structured Threat Information Expression (Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)) format. A Security Information And Event Management (Security Information And Event Management (SIEM)) alert automation using Security Orchestration Automation And Response (Security Orchestration Automation And Response (SOAR)) reduced Mean Time To Detect (Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)) and Mean Time To Repair (Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)) metrics substantially, while the Security Operations Center (Security Operations Center (SOC)) team maintained compliance with Center For Internet Security (Center For Internet Security (CIS)) v8 benchmarks.

In HRTech, our Human Capital Management (Human Capital Management (HCM)) and Applicant Tracking System (Applicant Tracking System (ATS)) platforms synchronized via Representational State Transfer (Representational State Transfer (REST)) and GraphQL endpoints. Employee OKRs were linked to Learning Management System (Learning Management System (LMS)) course completions, and Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion (Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion (DEI)) reporting dashboards tracked gender parity KPIs quarterly. Payroll APIs interfaced with National Automated Clearing House Association (National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA)) and Single Euro Payments Area (Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)) protocols to ensure timely multi-currency disbursements.

The supply-chain transformation incorporated Radio Frequency Identification (Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)) and IoT telemetry into Manufacturing Execution System (Manufacturing Execution System (MES)) and Product Lifecycle Management (Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)) systems. Predictive maintenance was achieved using AutoML models trained on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA)) streams, identifying anomalies in Overall Equipment Effectiveness (Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)) and Mean Time Between Failures (Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)) metrics. Blockchain-based provenance tracking ensured Service Level Agreement (Service Level Agreement (SLA)) transparency for suppliers via Hyperledger Fabric nodes.

The product roadmap for FY26 includes integration of Robotic Process Automation (Robotic Process Automation (RPA)) bots for invoice Optical Character Recognition (Optical Character Recognition (OCR)), digital twin simulations via Unity-Machine Learning (Machine Learning (ML)), and synthetic data generation with Generative Adversarial Network (Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)) pipelines. The architecture team plans to add a Federated Reinforcement Learning (Reinforcement Learning (RL)) module for personalization while integrating Secure Access Service Edge (Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)) security controls across Wide Area Network (Wide Area Network (WAN)) edges. Combined, these initiatives will strengthen the company’s position ahead of Initial Public Offering (Initial Public Offering (IPO)) readiness.
