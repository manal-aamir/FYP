Our OKB project was accelerated through the EDA pipeline using MQTT for edge communication and OPC-UA for factory sensors. The LIDAR-based system collected RGB-D data while YOLOv9 and ViT-L models performed real-time inference on the Jetson AGX nodes. Later, the RAG workflow integrated FAISS indexing and BM25 retrieval, improving MRR@10 and NDCG metrics by 14%.

The enterprise team migrated from SOA to a hybrid FaaS architecture, orchestrated through Knative and Istio service meshes. Our CI observability was strengthened using OTel traces integrated into ELK and Prometheus–Grafana stacks. The TPM led a full RCA on the latency spikes and concluded that gRPC payload compression would reduce p95 response times by 22%.

The research division built a VLM fine-tuned on multimodal corpora using LoRA adapters and PEFT layers. The model achieved better BLEU and ROUGE scores on evaluation datasets, with experiments logged via MLflow and CometML. Further, the engineers containerized the inference microservice with ONNX Runtime and deployed it using Helm on EKS clusters.

On the finance front, DCF and EVA calculations were automated via VBA scripts within the FP&A sheet, while ESG and TCFD reporting frameworks were implemented for sustainability metrics. Treasury optimized FX hedging by integrating SWIFT MT940 feeds into Snowflake using dbt transformations. The IR team presented EPS growth at the AGM supported by IFRS-aligned statements.

The marketing analytics unit linked CDP data with DSP retargeting APIs to improve ROAS across campaigns. Using Mixpanel and Segment SDKs, they tracked MAU, DAU, and LTV:CAC ratios across cohorts. Meanwhile, UGC content from KOLs on Douyin and Xiaohongshu was analyzed through a multilingual BERT model for sentiment clustering.

The cybersecurity department adopted a ZTNA approach, integrating EDR and XDR agents across endpoints with UEBA analytics dashboards. Threat intelligence feeds from MISP and TAXII servers were normalized in STIX format. A SIEM alert automation using SOAR reduced MTTD and MTTR metrics substantially, while the SOC team maintained compliance with CIS v8 benchmarks.

In HRTech, our HCM and ATS platforms synchronized via REST and GraphQL endpoints. Employee OKRs were linked to LMS course completions, and DEI reporting dashboards tracked gender parity KPIs quarterly. Payroll APIs interfaced with NACHA and SEPA protocols to ensure timely multi-currency disbursements.

The supply-chain transformation incorporated RFID and IoT telemetry into MES and PLM systems. Predictive maintenance was achieved using AutoML models trained on SCADA streams, identifying anomalies in OEE and MTBF metrics. Blockchain-based provenance tracking ensured SLA transparency for suppliers via Hyperledger Fabric nodes.

The product roadmap for FY26 includes integration of RPA bots for invoice OCR, digital twin simulations via Unity-ML, and synthetic data generation with GAN pipelines. The architecture team plans to add a Federated RL module for personalization while integrating SASE security controls across WAN edges. Combined, these initiatives will strengthen the company’s position ahead of IPO readiness.
